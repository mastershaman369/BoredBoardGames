## Contribution & Customization

- All contributors must keep documentation up to date.
- README.md always links to all technical docs and is the entry point for new contributors or resuming work outside of Windsor.
- For questions, see the FAQ in [TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md](./TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md).
- See phase plans for detailed requirements ([Phase 3](./PHASE_3_MARKETPLACE_PLAN.md), [Phase 4](./PHASE_4_COMMUNITY_PLAN.md), [Phase 5](./PHASE_5_ENTERPRISE_PLAN.md)).

---

## Development

- All code, builds, and tests must remain in `~/Documents/GitHub/BoredBoardGames`.
- See TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW.md and phase plans for stack, roadmap, and workflow rules.

---

## Security & Workflow

- Never commit secrets or sensitive data.
- All changes must be tested end-to-end before commit/push.
- Tag stable releases as `get` (e.g., `get-v1.0.0`).
- Only push tested, stable code to `main`.
- Use secure secrets management and environment variables in hosting/CI.
- Monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- Enforce HTTPS in production.

---

## CI/CD & Production Readiness (Phase 2+)

- Automated testing (Pytest, Jest, Cypress) is required before deployment.
- CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) builds, tests, and deploys to Staging/Production.
- All secrets managed securely (never committed to Git).
- Logging and Sentry error tracking are active in all environments.
- Staging and Production environments are separated (secrets, DBs, deploy targets).
